# Smart-bottle
A basic IoT smart bottle that detects the water level and temperature of water (or any fluid inside) and sends this data to a mobile application. This project forms the basis for an automated thermos that can pre heat the fluid inside after the temperature falls below a threshold limit pre decided by the user.
